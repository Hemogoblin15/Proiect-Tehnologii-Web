      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Manners Matter! aims to create a responsive web application based on a service-oriented architecture that
        supports learning and recommending norms and rules of behavior (etiquette) on the internet. The application will
        offer practical advice on how to behave in different online contexts and events, including academic,
        work-related, family-related, and group-related situations, among others. The recommendations will be tailored
        to each user's profile, taking into account demographic factors, professional training, social status, culture,
        and other relevant information.</p>
      <p>The proposed project will contribute to improving online behavior and promoting digital etiquette by providing
        practical advice to users on how to interact respectfully and appropriately in different online environments.

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>The methodology of this project involves using HTML and CSS for the frontend development, which will be
        responsible for creating an attractive and user-friendly interface for the web application. Node.js will be used
        for backend development, providing the necessary server-side functionality to support the service-based
        architecture. The system will be designed to suggest relevant and practical behavioral advice based on the user
        profile and the type of online context/event. To achieve this, the system will monitor the progress made by each
        user in the learning process, which may be structured by levels of difficulty. Basic functionalities will also
        be provided through a Web REST/GraphQL API. Additionally, the system will generate a ranking of the most
        successful users, which will be available as an RSS data feed. By following this methodology, we aim to deliver
        a comprehensive and effective web application that will support learning and recommending norms and rules of
        behavior on the internet.</p>

    <section id="discussion">
      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p> Manners, or social etiquette, are a set of unwritten rules that guide our interactions with others. They
        encompass everything from saying "please" and "thank you" to how we dress and behave in public. While some may
        argue that manners are simply a form of social conditioning or unnecessary formalities, there are several
        reasons why manners matter.</p>

      <p> Firstly, manners help to establish respect and consideration for others. When we use polite language and show
        good manners, we demonstrate that we value the people we are interacting with and are considerate of their
        feelings. This, in turn, helps to build positive relationships with others and can lead to better communication
        and cooperation.</p>

      <p> Secondly, manners can help to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts. By following social etiquette, we are
        able to communicate our intentions clearly and avoid causing offense or confusion. This is especially important
        in today's diverse and multicultural society where people come from different backgrounds and have different
        cultural norms.</p>

      <p> Lastly, good manners can help to boost our own self-confidence and self-esteem. When we know how to behave in
        different social situations, we feel more comfortable and confident in our interactions with others. This can
        lead to increased social opportunities, career success, and a general sense of well-being.</p>

      <p> In summary, manners matter because they help us to show respect and consideration for others, avoid
        misunderstandings and conflicts, and boost our own self-confidence and self-esteem. By following social
        etiquette, we can create a more harmonious and respectful society where everyone feels valued and appreciated.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>In conclusion, the web application we aim to develop has the potential to be a valuable tool for anyone who wishes to improve their online communication skills and manners. With the increasing reliance on digital communication, the importance of proper etiquette on the internet cannot be overstated. By providing practical advice and information tailored to different contexts and audiences, our application can empower users to communicate more effectively and appropriately online. Additionally, the monitoring and feedback features can help users track their progress and encourage them to continue developing their skills. Ultimately, we believe that this application has the potential to enhance online communication and promote a more respectful and inclusive online community.</p>
